ViewUnresolvedRequests
======================

UML Diagrams for a tech service application

These were created as part of a semester long group project to identify and provide solutions to a fictitious computer repair and installation company. The company needed a new way to track and dispatch service requests. These UML diagrams were created to show different aspects of the requirement to view unresolved service requests.
